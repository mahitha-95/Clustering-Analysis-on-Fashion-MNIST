# Clustering-Analysis-on-Fashion-MNIST
Real world data doesnâ€™t often come with pre-defined labels, so we have machine learning models that can correctly classify the data by finding some commonality in the features, which will be used in the predictions. An unsupervised learning method is a method in which we draw references from datasets consisting of input data without labeled responses. Generally, it is used as a process to find meaningful structure, explanatory underlying processes, generative features, and groupings inherent in a set of examples. Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique where we group the data points. For a set of data points without any labels, we use a clustering algorithm to classify each data point into a specific group. Data points in the same group have similar features while those in different groups have different features. In this project, we analyze the performance of different clustering algorithms like K-Means clustering, Autoencoder-based K-Means clustering and Autoencoder with Gaussian Mixture Model clustering.
